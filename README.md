This website is a collection of interesting public sites 404 pages. These are various 404 pages from different websites that I found interesting.
Live at [last.yush.dev](https://last.yush.dev)

The context is changed from being a 404 Not Found page to a Last Page. The idea is to make the user feel like they have reached the last webpage and are at the end of the internet.
_(This is with assumption that is someone is visiting my website, they are pretty much at the end of the internet as my website is not that popular.)_

There are multiple variants of the last pages. Each is a different variant in it's own directory.

The switching is done randomly. So, every time you visit the website, you will see a different variant.
This logic is hosted on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) and the website is self-hosted on my homelab servers.
Switching logic can be found in [src/cloudflare_worker.js](/aayusharyan/last-page-collection/blob/main/src/cloudflare_worker.js).

## How to add your own Variant

Please raise an issue with the following details:
