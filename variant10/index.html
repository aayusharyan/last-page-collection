    <font size=+4>Congratulations!</font>
  <p align=center><b>You have finally reached the end of the internet!</b><br>
    There's nothing more to see, no more links to visit.<br>
    You've done it all.<br>
    This is the very last page on the very last server at the very far end of the internet.
  <p align=center>You should now turn off your computer and go do something useful with the rest of your life. *
  <p>Suggestions:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Read a book
    <li>Do some public service
    <li>Personally interact with your neighbors that you've probably only met online
    <li>Plant a tree
    <li>Introduce yourself to those other people who live at your house (your family).
  </ul>
